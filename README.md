# Final project for IBM's ML course on Coursera

This repository contains the final Jupyter notebook and the datasets used.

The goal of this project was to use 4 machine learning algorithms to predict
if a person repays a loan or does not. Several features were used such a person's
education level, what time they took a loan out, and more. 

The 4 algorithms are: k-NN, Decision Tree, SVM, and Logistic Regression.
The resulting models were then evaluated using a multitude of metrics, such as
Jaccard score, F-1 score, and Log loss. 

The included datasets do NOT belong to me and were strictly used in educational
purposes as instructed by IBM's course.
